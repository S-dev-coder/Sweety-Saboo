                                <p><b>Hii !   I am Sweety Saboo.</b><br><br>A devoted company secretary with a profound
                                    connection to spirituality and yoga.<br> My transformative journey began back in
                                    2004 under the insightful guidance of Sri Sri Ravishankar ji. From that point
                                    forward, my life has been a fusion of professional responsibilities and a deep
                                    passion for enhancing both mental and physical well-being through Yoga, Meditation,
                                    and even the ancient Indian Martial Art, Kalaripayattu.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I take immense pride in being a certified yoga trainer, allowing me to share the
                                    wisdom and benefits of this ancient practice with others. In West Bengal, I hold the
                                    role of a Sri Sri Yoga coordinator, allowing me to contribute to the community's
                                    well-being and growth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of my most fulfilling endeavors involves leading a vibrant team of 103 young
                                    individuals in Kolkata, collectively known as the "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/youthofkolkata/"
                                        target="_blank"><b>Youth of Kolkata</b></a>". Our shared
                                    mission revolves around harnessing the boundless energy of the youth to create a
                                    positive impact on society. Moreover, I'm currently dedicated to working alongside a
                                    group of resilient young girls who have been rescued, with the goal of bringing them
                                    peace, strength, and the joy they deserve.
                                    <br><br>
                                    My achievements also extend to successfully organizing and conducting the
                                    International Day of Yoga for a diverse gathering of 800 participants, transcending
                                    barriers of caste, religion, and profession. My skill set further expands to
                                    encompass India's martial art form, Kalaripayattu. I firmly believe in nurturing the
                                    youth's holistic development by not just focusing on academic knowledge, but also on
                                    ancient texts and practical skills.
                                    <br><br>
                                    My journey has been marked by reaching out to lives across different communities,
                                    teaching them the globally renowned technique of Sudarshan Kriya. I've ventured into
                                    the remotest corners of Bihar to impart basic education and meditation practices to
                                    both children and elders. Beyond my pursuits in yoga and martial arts, I find solace
                                    in playing the Veena and expressing myself through dance.
                                    <br><br>
                                    With an unwavering vision, I aspire to spread happiness and bring smiles to every
                                    face by cultivating physical and mental strength. For me, the mantra that resonates
                                    is, "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/happiness.centre.5th.avenue/" target="_blank"><b>A calm and joyful mind serves as the fertile
                                            ground for creativity and
                                            dynamism</b></a>". Through my endeavors, I hope to contribute positively to
                                    the world around
                                    me, leaving it a better place for future generations.
